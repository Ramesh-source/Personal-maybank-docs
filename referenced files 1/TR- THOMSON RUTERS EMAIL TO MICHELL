Hi Michelle,

As verified configurations for world check api there is no IP address configured in RBS side, we only have configured the domain name in product state file as mentioned below.


 

However, I am not sure if we need to install new certificates since there is a change in the IP address for the pilot environment.
For prod, I guess we should install new cert since both IP and domain changed. 

I hope there is no change in https://signon.thomsonreuters.com.

Hi Ashok,

Kindly let us know if there any configuratios/steps 


Thanks
