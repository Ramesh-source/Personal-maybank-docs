Last working day at Maybank


Dear All,

As you know, I’m leaving from my position at Maybank and today is my last working day. Working with Maybank has been a great pleasure, and I really appreciate the support, guidance and continued encouragement that you offered me through all the times. 

I’d like to mention about my managers Naga and Eden during IDH tenure and Wai Meng in CF Dept for their great support. And my special thanks to Abhinav and Max Ng for their continuous support in SCORE project.

I wish everyone all the best and hopefully we can keep in touch. I can be reached at praveenk.it@gmail.com and +60169825063

Thank you very much.

Regards,
Praveen.
